# Hotel Booking App üè®

## Project Summary

The Hotel Booking App is a full-stack web application that allows users to search for hotels, create hotels, view hotel details, make secure bookings using Stripe, and manage their reservations through a dedicated dashboard. Users can also view their past bookings in a history page, and cancel upcoming reservations directly from the app.

The backend is powered by Express and MongoDB, while the frontend uses React with Vite for a fast development workflow. TailwindCSS provides modern, responsive styling, and Playwright is used for end-to-end testing. Both frontend and backend are easily run with `npm run dev`.
